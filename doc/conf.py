# Some modules need to import things just so that sphinx can resolve symbols in
# type annotations. Often, we do not want these imports (e.g. of PyOpenCL) when
# in normal use (because they would introduce unintended side effects or hard
# dependencies). This flag exists so that these imports only occur during doc
# build. Since sphinx appears to resolve type hints lexically (as it should),
# this needs to be cross-module (since, e.g. an inherited arraycontext
# docstring can be read by sphinx when building meshmode, a dependent package),
# this needs a setting of the same name across all packages involved, that's
# why this name is as global-sounding as it is.
