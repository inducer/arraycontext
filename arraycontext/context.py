Freezing and thawing
--------------------

One of the central concepts introduced by the array context formalism is
the notion of :meth:`~arraycontext.ArrayContext.freeze` and
:meth:`~arraycontext.ArrayContext.thaw`. Each array handled by the array context
is either "thawed" or "frozen". Unlike the real-world concept of freezing and
thawing, these operations leave the original array alone; instead, a semantically
separate array in the desired state is returned.

*   "Thawed" arrays are associated with an array context. They use that context
    to carry out operations (arithmetic, function calls).

*   "Frozen" arrays are static data. They are not associated with an array context,
    and no operations can be performed on them.

Freezing and thawing may be used to move arrays from one array context to another,
as long as both array contexts use identical in-memory data representation.
Otherwise, a common format must be agreed upon, for example using
:mod:`numpy` through :meth:`~arraycontext.ArrayContext.to_numpy` and
:meth:`~arraycontext.ArrayContext.from_numpy`.

.. _freeze-thaw-guidelines:

Usage guidelines
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Here are some rules of thumb to use when dealing with thawing and freezing:

-   Any array that is stored for a long time needs to be frozen.
    "Memoized" data (cf. :func:`pytools.memoize` and friends) is a good example
    of long-lived data that should be frozen.

-   Within a function, if the user did not supply an array context,
    then any data returned to the user should be frozen.

-   Note that array contexts need not necessarily be passed as a separate
    argument. Passing thawed data as an argument to a function suffices
    to supply an array context. The array context can be extracted from
    a thawed argument using, e.g., :func:`~arraycontext.get_container_context_opt`
    or :func:`~arraycontext.get_container_context_recursively`.

What does this mean concretely?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Freezing and thawing are abstract names for concrete operations. It may be helpful
to understand what these operations mean in the concrete case of various
actual array contexts:

-   Each :class:`~arraycontext.PyOpenCLArrayContext` is associated with a
    :class:`pyopencl.CommandQueue`. In order to operate on array data,
    such a command queue is necessary; it is the main means of synchronization
    between the host program and the compute device. "Thawing" here
    means associating an array with a command queue, and "freezing" means
    ensuring that the array data is fully computed in memory and
    decoupling the array from the command queue. It is not valid to "mix"
    arrays associated with multiple queues within an operation: if it were allowed,
    a dependent operation might begin computing before an input is fully
    available. (Since bugs of this nature would be very difficult to
    find, :class:`pyopencl.array.Array` and
    :class:`~meshmode.dof_array.DOFArray` will not allow them.)

-   For the lazily-evaluating array context based on :mod:`pytato`,
    "thawing" corresponds to the creation of a symbolic "handle"
    (specifically, a :class:`pytato.array.DataWrapper`) representing
    the array that can then be used in computation, and "freezing"
    corresponds to triggering (code generation and) evaluation of
    an array expression that has been built up by the user
    (using, e.g. :func:`pytato.generate_loopy`).
